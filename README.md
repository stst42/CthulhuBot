# Purpose of this repository
Being an useR, despite there're packages in R to manage Keras + Tensorflow, I decided to use them in Python because:

- I wanted to start to learn Python
- I'd like to learn something about Deep Learning

So the first serious approach on Deep Learning has been in Python, with generative networks.
I am a fan of H.P.Lovecraft and I think I've read almost every of his works: so, why not melt my passion for his writings with my passion for machine learning?

So Here we go.
