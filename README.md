# GITGenerativeNetwork
Repository to study Generative Deep Learning

# Purpose of this repository
Being an useR, despite there're packages in R to manage Keras + Tensorflow, I decided to use them in Python because:

- I wanted to start to learn Python
- I'd like to learn something about Deep Learning

So the first serious approach on Deep Learning has been in Python, with generative networks.
I am a fan of H.P.Lovecraft and I think I've read almost every of his works: so, why not melt my passion for his writings with my passion for machine learning?

So Here we go.

# Purpose of this wall of text
In this write up I'm going to write a kind of diary about what I am doing.

# Some infos about hardware and software
Training a Neural Network could be an hard job for your machine.
It has been very difficult with only CPU, but if you invest some time in learning and -you got hardware-, with GPU it is way better and faster. The job is not too much easy: I messed up with the NVIDIA docs, but in the end I've found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHWkvEcDBO0) enlighting. However you can find some infos on NVIDIA, despite for example my GPU does not appear in the CUDA enabled, but it is.
However some infos:


Python 3<br>
Win 11 machine<br>
AMD Ryzen 5 400 series <br>
NVidia GEFORCE GTX 1650<br>
32GB RAM<br>
